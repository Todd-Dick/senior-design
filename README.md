# senior-design
This repository contains the iOS portion of my senior design project. The app has a dummy login and settings pages. The app uses a table view to create new items. The app records and transcribes voice messages. It has the code in place to connect to and send a JSON message to a database via a RESTful API... Ours was part of a Django webservice app developed by a team member.
